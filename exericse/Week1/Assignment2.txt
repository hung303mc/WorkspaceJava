Write a program to create new images that are photographic negatives 
(or inverted images) of selected images and save these new images 
with filenames that are related to the original images, 
such as adding “inverted-” in front of the old filename. 
In inverting an image, a pixel’s red, blue, and green components 
are modified to be the exact opposite within the 0 to 255 range. 
That is, if a pixel’s red, blue, and green values are (34, 198, 240), 
then that same pixel in the inverted image would have 
the red, blue and green values of (221, 57, 15). 
Note that 255 - 34 is 221, 255 - 198 is 57, and 255 - 240 is 15.

/*
* Step 1 Work Example by hand
*/
- read image in folder (print name to test)
- create a blank image + save with new filename
- pixel --> 255-Pixel
